This repository stores my NeoVim config. To be honest I'm not sure if this is directly applicable to a vim config, due to it being written in lua.

Either way I recommend you switch to NeoVim. 
This config has everything you need to code, edit latex docs, and even org-mode (I'm looking at you emacs users).
Like my emacs config I don't recommend copy pasting everything but it is certainly possible.
